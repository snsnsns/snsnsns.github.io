I'm Sarah, a designer based in Vermont. I've created this page to highlight some design and branding work that might appeal to you in your search for a contract senior designer.

As a brand designer, I've created packaging designs for a health-oriented grocery chain's private label, designed the brand and identity for a Vermont food security nonprofit, and created swag for other graphic designers for an AIGA group in California. Here is a showcase of that highlighted work:

### Marketing design for Healthy Living
For the past three years, as a consultant for [Healthy Living markets](https://healthylivingtogo.com), I have been instrumental in the environmental signage design at HL stores in South Burlington, Williston, and Saratoga Springs, NY. Through my digital marketing efforts, the company has a robust trade partners program with small and local food-oriented businesses who we partner with to create special in-store marketing, targeted Google ads and META ads. I've been dedicated to the branding and member development of the Core Shopper loyalty program that includes weekly deals to target shoppers.

## Packaging Design for Healthy Living
Healthy Living launched a private label and I've been involved with the packaging design for many products, from vitamins to coffee packaging. This cold brew design is being relaunched this summer along with another canned coffee product.

And for seasonal in-store packaging, I created this custom logo for eco-friendly reusable salad bar containers at Healthy Living.

## Reusable bags design
I designed reusable bags with drop-shift citrus patterns for Healthy Living in spring 2023.

## Newsletter graphics
Mobile-first newsletter Figma graphics advertise Best Deals, HL To-Go, and offer a friendly note from the store-founding family.

## Digital web ads
I designed these web ads for Healthy Living for recruiting new employees on the highly trafficked Seven Days site as rotating "site skin" ads for the news site pages.

## Loyalty rewards program
I've been working with the locally-owned and operated grocery chain, Healthy Living, since the Fall of 2022. The Healthy Living brand is evolving and we are marketing new incentives to a loyal customer base with a robust rewards program (Core Shoppers). Besides customers, I've also served the brand and design needs of local businesses partners selling their products within the stores.

## Digital menu design
I continually revise and redesign digital menus for the Williston deli counter. Here is a recent iteration.

### Branding a food-insecurity nonprofit in White River Valley
Since fall 2024, I've been working with Feeding the Valley Alliance in Rochester, Vermont to create the group a solid brand identity with a web presence and print collateral. The goals are to spread awareness of group, to find new restaurants and farmers to donate more food, to advertise community food offerings, and to reduce any stigma from accepting free food.

Below are some highlights of the brand guidelines as we move forward on the website design.

## Main logo and smaller web logo design
After first a round of loose sketches, followed up with three finalized one-color options, the nonprofit board chose this simple spoon and fork design. As a secondary logo, I created a circular logo for conditions in which a square or round logo would look better (stickers, pins, corner of web sites, etc.)

</div>

## Color Palette
The color palette is grounded in the tones of spring and harvest season: light and deep greens like fresh produce, along with the purple and orange like the root vegetables of fall.

## Typography
The type I chose is organic feeling and friendly, offering a serious but warm tone. They are part of the Google fonts library, making it an economical choice for the nonprofit.

## Pattern and Texture
For the website, I will incorporate various patterned and textured backgrounds to offer more visual variety along with the information.

## Visualization of logo in use
I created visual mockups of a simple logo in possible use scenarios.

### Event & Swag Design for AIGA Santa Barbara
As a volunteer board member for AIGA in California, I designed and planned a conference for young designers to meet with mentors for career advice, networking, and for a formal portfolio review. For the event, I created a lot of collateral: posters, fake tattoos, t-shirts and buttons.

## Event Poster for AIGA
I designed this poster for AIGA Santa Barbara advertising the portfolio review day.

And here is the fun swag: temporary tattoos, small buttons, and we screen printed t-shirts with the event design too.
