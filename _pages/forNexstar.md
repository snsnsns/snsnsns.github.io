description: A look at Sarah Schumacher's work in editorial, marketing, event, digital, social media and packaging design
---

I'm Sarah, a visual designer based in Middlebury. I've created this specific page to highlight some of the work that might appeal to you in your search for a graphic artist at Nexstar.

In recent design roles, I have worn many hats: art director, marketing designer, news designer, photographer, writer, editor, videographer, social  media editor. At [Voice Media Group](https://www.voicemediagroup.com/_) a media conglomerate with news sites in Dallas, Phoenix, Miami and Denver, I collaborated with cross-functional teams and organized complex projects to meet tight deadlines. Every year, I managed the creative for an omnichannel product (web, social, television and print) called “Best of Dallas.” This required hiring, directing and managing many vendors (photographers, models, writers, editors, illustrators, videographers, marketers) to design and launch a blockbuster product for all of Dallas.

I'd like to showcase some of the work that I've done that might help you see my capabilities:

### Work Examples

## Editorial visual illustrations for Bloomberg News CityLab
Bloomberg News CityLab takes a deep dive into all the municiple issues of cities internationally. That includes large architectural projects. Since June 2024, I've been creating editorial visuals to depict the nuances of contemporary architecture projects in a CityLab column called ["Look at that Building."](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-23/introducing-look-at-that-building-a-series-that-explains-skylines)

## Digital ads for Healthy Living recruitment
I've been working with the locally-owned and operated grocery chain, Healthy Living, since the Fall of 2022. I designed these web ads for Healthy Living using the newest brand standards in Fall 2023 for recruiting new employees on the highly trafficked [Seven Days site](https://www.sevendaysvt.com) as rotating "site skin" ads for the news site pages.

## Reusable bags design
I designed reusable bags with drop-shift citrus patterns for Healthy Living in spring 2023.

Another fun project was creating these cooler bags which are sturdy and attractive. It is my favorite cooler bag to shop with.

## Product signage at Healthy Living South Burlington and Saratoga Springs stores
I've designed many types of signage for Healthy Living. Here are a few signs with special purchase deals and one infographic poster about avocado sourcing.

### Dallas Observer Social Media
In the social media space, I have experience planning and designing digital marketing campaigns. As a marketing designer at Voice Media Group, I shot photos, hired photographers and curated photos, created graphics, wrote content and built a fun social media persona and built community through VMG's Dallas Observer Instagram account. I hired photographers to shoot events and then edited and selected photos for use on the various VMG platforms.

## Marketing video from Iron Fork 
Voice Media Group has many marketed events alongside their news sites. Iron Fork is an annual foodie event with local restaurants bringing small plates to serve to guests. The event also has a local chef cook-off presentation. I filmed and edited video of the 2017 Iron Fork for VMG's site Dallas Observer.

## Event and video design from Dallas Observer Music Awards
Every year, Dallas Observer highlights the best musical acts trending in the city. For VMG's marketing department, I created the event brand which involved designing the logo/graphic for the event, the awards design, display ads, projected videos to introduce speakers and performers and visuals for performances.

And I commissioned this video of 2016 Dallas Observer Music Awards that shows the event design, award design, presentation graphics and cohesive background video design.

Along with the poster, I created swag: temporary tattoos, small buttons, and we screen printed shirts with the design too.
