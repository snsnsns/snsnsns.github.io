Here is some current work from California State University that speaks to the variety of projects that I have taken on there:

### Recruitment
This is a two-sided brochure with the top ten reasons to attend CSUCI. The reverse side is a campus photo and hashtag phrase that recruitment uses for social media engagement.

This is a postcard invitation to incoming freshman to visit campus for an early orientation and community building event in which the university is able to compile data as to which students they are targeting are following through with enrollment.

### Branding
**Project AYUDAS** is a grant-based project to support first-generation college students to find academic success in science, technology, engineering and math. This is the full-color logo I created for their project.

In another branding project of CSUCI, called **Channel Your Success**, I designed banners for campus. The image to the left is a mockup of the banner. The image on the right is a mock up of the logo on a banner on campus.

### Publications

Recruitment and Enrollment department needed internship hiring guides for both students ([Internship Guide for Students, Faculty and Staff](https://issuu.com/csu-channel-islands/docs/2021_internshipguidestudentfaculty_issuu)) and potential employers ([Internship Toolkit for Employers and Community Partners](https://issuu.com/csu-channel-islands/docs/2021_employerinternshiptoolkit_issuu)). These toolkits work as an internship guides for both parties.

**Channel magazine** includes alumni features, profiles on major donors, campus news in the community, and a Spring listing of donors and fundraising data.

*I often hire photographers, videographers and illustrators and direct their work. I know many talented photographers and illustrators working in Vermont that we could tap for magazine feature photographer or larger advertising campaign work.*

**Assign projects to the design staff, either as single-person producers or as members of larger creative teams.**

*I'm good with delegating work and not micro-managing people. I find respect for individual talent and making expectations clear goes far in meeting goals.*

**Be an ongoing resource for the project managers and printing and mailing teams bringing insight, support, and problem solving.**

*I am happy to be an oracle of information relating to the status of projects, correct mail codes, technology support, etc.*
