## To the hiring team at Aqua ViTea,

I'm Sarah, a graphic designer and digital marketer based in Middlebury. I've created this specific page to highlight some of the work that might appeal to you in your search for a graphic designer for digital marketing in the health and beverage space. I love Aqua ViTea's products and would love the chance to help build your delightful brand.

I have five years experience enhancing brand awareness through digital marketing and social media. Most recently, I've been working with the team at [Healthy Living Market](https://www.healthylivingmarket.com) creating digital assets for email marketing, web display ads for sites such as Seven Days, designing display ads for marketing at UVM sporting events creating in-store signage, and designing brand packaging and customer-targeted products (shopping bags, reusable utensils, stickers, apparel and accessories).

## Branding and packaging
I designed the labels for the newly-release private label cold-brew coffee from Healthy Living. I filmed this web video debuting the new product.

## Digital ads for recruitment
I designed these web ads using the newest brand standards in Fall 2023 for recruiting new employees on the highly trafficked [Seven Days site](https://www.sevendaysvt.com) as rotating "site skin" ads for the news site pages.

In the social media space, I have experience planning and designing digital marketing campaigns. As a marketing designer at Voice Media Group, I helped build a fun social media persona and built community through VMG's Dallas Observer Instagram account. While working for Voice Media Group, I photographed marketing-sponsored events. I also commissioned, filmed and edited short web videos recapping the event. For Voice Media Group sponsored events, I created event branding for display ads, projected videos to introduce speakers and performers and visuals for performances. For sales and marketing, I created many presentation decks to sell VMG's unique digital marketing capabilities.

## Social Media Posts



## Marketing video from Iron Fork 
Voice Media Group has many marketed events alongside their news sites. Iron Fork is an annual foodie event with local restaurants bringing small plates to serve to guests. The event also has a local chef cook-off presentation. I filmed and edited video of the 2017 Iron Fork for VMG's site Dallas Observer.

## More Packaging Design
As a freelance designer, I designed for [Alive & Well TV](https://aliveandwell.tv/) a conceptual suite of products for a health supplement brand, Chia 3.
