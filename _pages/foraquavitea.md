description: A look at Sarah Schumacher's work in marketing, event, social media and packaging design
---

I'm Sarah, a graphic designer and digital marketer based in Middlebury. I've created this specific page to highlight some of the work that might appeal to you in your search for a graphic designer for digital marketing in the health and beverage space. I love Aqua ViTea's products and would love the chance to help build your delightful brand.

I have five years experience enhancing brand awareness through digital marketing and social media. Most recently, I've been working with the team at [Healthy Living Market](https://www.healthylivingmarket.com) creating digital assets for email marketing, web display ads for sites such as Seven Days, designing display ads for marketing at UVM sporting events creating in-store signage, and designing brand packaging and customer-targeted products (shopping bags, reusable utensils, stickers, apparel and accessories).

Before working for Healthy Living, I spent five years working for Voice Media Group, a media conglomerate with news sites in Dallas, Phoenix, Miami and Denver. I wore many hats at VMG, including marketing designer, news designer, photographer, writer, editor, videographer, social  media editor. 

I'd like to showcase some of the work that I've done that might help you see my capabilities:

## Branding and packaging for Healthy Living
I designed the labels for the newly-release private label cold-brew coffee from Healthy Living and created an Instagram reel for the debut. These coffee drinks are available for purchase in store.

I created this custom logo for eco-friendly reusable salad bar containers at Healthy Living.

## Digital ads for Healthy Living recruitment
I designed these web ads for Healthy Living using the newest brand standards in Fall 2023 for recruiting new employees on the highly trafficked [Seven Days site](https://www.sevendaysvt.com) as rotating "site skin" ads for the news site pages.

Another fun project was creating these cooler bags which are sturdy and attractive. It is my favorite cooler bag to shop with.

## Social Media Posts
In the social media space, I have experience planning and designing digital marketing campaigns. As a marketing designer at Voice Media Group, I shot photos, hired photographers and curated photos, created graphics, wrote content and built a fun social media persona and built community through VMG's Dallas Observer Instagram account. I hired photographers to shoot events and then edited and selected photos for use on the various VMG platforms.

## Marketing video from Iron Fork 
Voice Media Group has many marketed events alongside their news sites. Iron Fork is an annual foodie event with local restaurants bringing small plates to serve to guests. The event also has a local chef cook-off presentation. I filmed and edited video of the 2017 Iron Fork for VMG's site Dallas Observer.

## Event and video design from Dallas Observer Music Awards
 Every year, Dallas Observer highlights the best musical acts trending in the city. For VMG's marketing department, I created the event brand which involved designing the logo/graphic for the event, the awards design, display ads, projected videos to introduce speakers and performers and visuals for performances.

And I commissioned this video of 2016 Dallas Observer Music Awards that shows the event design, award design, presentation graphics and cohesive background video design. <em>Video by Sarah Passon</em>
