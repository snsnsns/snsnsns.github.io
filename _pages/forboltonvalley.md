description: A look at Sarah Schumacher's work in marketing, event, social media and packaging design
---

I'm Sarah, a graphic designer, digital marketer, writer/editor and photographer based in Middlebury. I've created this specific page to highlight some of the work that might appeal to you in your search for a marketing coordinator and graphic designer.

 Most recently, I've been working on a contract basis with the team at [Healthy Living Market](https://www.healthylivingmarket.com) creating digital assets for email marketing, web display ads for sites such as Seven Days, designing display ads for marketing at UVM sporting events creating in-store signage, and designing brand packaging and customer-targeted products (shopping bags, reusable utensils, stickers, apparel and accessories).

In my prior marketing design role, I wore many hats: marketing designer, news designer, photographer, writer, editor, videographer, social  media editor. At [Voice Media Group](https://www.voicemediagroup.com/_) a media conglomerate with news sites in Dallas, Phoenix, Miami and Denver, I collaborated with cross-functional teams and organized complex projects to meet tight deadlines. Every year, I managed the creative for an omnichannel product (web, social, television and print) called “Best of Dallas.” This required hiring, directing and managing many vendors (photographers, models, writers, editors, illustrators, videographers, marketers) to design and launch a blockbuster product for all of Dallas.

I'd like to showcase some of the work that I've done that might help you see my capabilities:

## Branding and packaging for Healthy Living
I designed the a new suite of private label products for Healthy Living including this cold-brew coffee label.

I filmed a YouTube short/reel to showcase the design. These coffee drinks are available for purchase in store.

## Digital ads for Healthy Living recruitment
I designed these web ads for Healthy Living using the newest brand standards in Fall 2023 for recruiting new employees on the highly trafficked [Seven Days site](https://www.sevendaysvt.com) as rotating "site skin" ads for the news site pages.

Another fun project was creating these cooler bags which are sturdy and attractive. It is my favorite cooler bag to shop with.

## Product signage at Healthy Living South Burlington and Saratoga Springs stores
I've designed many types of signage for Healthy Living. Here are a few signs with special purchase deals and one infographic poster about avocado sourcing.

## Social Media Posts
In the social media space, I have experience planning and designing digital marketing campaigns. As a marketing designer at Voice Media Group, I shot photos, hired photographers and curated photos, created graphics, wrote content and built a fun social media persona and built community through VMG's Dallas Observer Instagram account. I hired photographers to shoot events and then edited and selected photos for use on the various VMG platforms.

## Marketing video from Iron Fork 
Voice Media Group has many marketed events alongside their news sites. Iron Fork is an annual foodie event with local restaurants bringing small plates to serve to guests. The event also has a local chef cook-off presentation. I filmed and edited video of the 2017 Iron Fork for VMG's site Dallas Observer.

## Event and video design from Dallas Observer Music Awards
 Every year, Dallas Observer highlights the best musical acts trending in the city. For VMG's marketing department, I created the event brand which involved designing the logo/graphic for the event, the awards design, display ads, projected videos to introduce speakers and performers and visuals for performances.

And I commissioned this video of 2016 Dallas Observer Music Awards that shows the event design, award design, presentation graphics and cohesive background video design. <em>Video by Sarah Passon</em>
