## To the hiring team at Middlebury College,

I'm Sarah, an art director and graphic designer with a deep history in editorial design and in higher education marketing design. This site page discusses my specific abilities as they would apply to role of creative director. 

I began my career in print magazine design, first working as a designer in Washington at *Foreign Policy* magazine, where my team was nominated for and won multiple awards for general excellence from the American Society of Magazine Editors. I later moved to New York to freelance at *Fortune*, then took a full time art director position with Condé Nast. When the publishing industry imploded in late 2008, I left New York to pursue a masters' degree in graphic design and typography from the University of Reading in England. 

I began working in marketing for higher education in 2012 in Camarillo, California. I was employed as a graphic designer with California State University, Channel Islands. The university was young, having been founded in 2002. I helped craft universal design standards for the university along with the web development team as we launched a new site and magazine. In the seven years since I stopped working full time for CSUCI, I have taken on projects that range from data visualizations to social media graphics to recruitment viewbooks.

After working in California, I took an art director position at Voice Media Group, which publishes newspapers and news sites in Miami, Denver, Phoenix, Houston, and Dallas. For the Dallas office (*Dallas Observer*), I ran the art department full time for three years and continue to support the company as a contract art director.

Now, I'm looking for a position where I can grow beyond a contract role. I'm looking for a position that reflects my Vermont community. I'm looking to work with a team to bring great ideas to life. I feel that the Middlebury College would be a good fit for these goals.

Here is some current work from California State University that speaks to the variety of projects that I have taken on there:

### Branding
**Project AYUDAS** is a grant-based project to support students of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI)s to find academic success in science, technology, engineering and math. This is the full-color logo I created for their project.

In another branding project of CSUCI, called **Channel Your Success**, we worked on creating messaging for banners on campus. The image to the left is a mockup of the banner. The image on the right is a mock up of the logo on a banner on campus.

### Recruitment
This is a two-sided brochure with the top ten reasons to attend CSUCI. The reverse side makes for a nice graphic poster with a hashtag recruitment uses for student engagement on social media.

This is a postcard invitation to incoming freshman to visit campus for an early orientation and community building event in which the university is able to compile data as to which students they are targeting are following through with enrollment.

Thank you for making it this far with the examples of work and about my history.

## Now for the Middlebury College part 
I read the open position requirements carefully. Here are the essential functions of the role mentioned in the job posting. I respond with my experience in *italic*.

**Supervise three teams—Graphic Design, Project Management, Printing and Mailing Services—with care and attention to their collaborations.**
*I have been acting as No. 2 at Voice Media Group/Dallas Observer since taking on role of art director in 2016. When I was a full-time employee, I supervised production and layout staff, hired, managed and directed photographers and illustrators, manage freelance designers.*
*In my role as an Associate Art Director at Condé Nast, I managed designers and photo retouchers. At Foreign Policy, I managed design interns.*

**Establish communications and marketing priorities with the vice president and leadership peers across the department.**
*Listening is key to making priorities. Once I have heard from all the stakeholders, I have no trouble sorting priorities for the work.*

**Guide big-picture design strategy and visual vocabulary to show authentic Middlebury to stakeholders in partnership with the vice president and key colleagues.**
*Having worked in an Advancement and University Marketing for ten years, I am very aware of the priorities that go into messaging. Storyboarding goes far in finding the correct tone and verbiage to get the attention of stakeholders. The conceptual phase can be rich with ideas. I quickly infuse the aesthetic and branding of the entity I am working for and try to advance the vision in healthy directions.*

**In Graphic Design, nurture creativity, spark, and fulfilling business goals of every project (among other priorities).**
*I love what I do and I love encouraging that joy and pride in work in my colleagues.*

**In Project Management, foster efficient workflow in a fluid environment with shared expectations of creatives and clients (among other priorities)**
*I have been managing simultaneous print projects with printers since 2003. Part of my role as an art director is to essentially be a production manager as well. I am grateful for the variety of modern project management tools that we can choose from, but a Gantt chart works great too. Communication and timeline priorities with all parties involved on a project is key. Every team needs to be on the same page about meeting deadlines. I am good at firm friendly pressure in getting deadlines met.*

**In Printing and Mailing Services, integrate expertise across the division, mindful of the goals of each project (among other priorities).**
*Understanding mailing indicia is an area in which I excell ;) *

**Supervise concepting and development of compelling designs in a high-volume, deadline-driven environment, including web, social media, print, photography, illustration, event collateral, video, and related media.**
*I work pretty quickly when a deadline is looming. I am well-versed with web, social media, print, photography, illustration, event collateral, video and multimedia design. I have designed for many projected spaces (event background and powerpoint presentations). Please look to my portfolio web site for examples.*

**Encourage pushing boundaries in design aligned with brand; promote the symbiosis of words and images; strive to reach heart and head with work that is human, colloquial, memorable—and able to meet business goals.**
*I'm happy to push boundaries, but for Middlebury College, the result still needs to strike the right tone. It needs to be clever and insightful, not brash. It seems like an exciting challenge for sure.*

**Take on an ambitious portfolio of designs, from ideation to final products.**
*Happy to do this.*

**Assist team members in determining appropriate freelancers and vendors and help orchestrate their work.**
*I often hire photographers, videographers and illustrators and direct their work. I know many talented photographers and illustrators working in Vermont that we could tap for magazine feature photographer or larger advertising campaign work.*

**Assign projects to the design staff, either as single-person producers or as members of larger creative teams.**
*I'm good with delegating work and not micro-managing people. I find respect for individual talent and making expectations clear goes far in meeting goals.*

**Be an ongoing resource for the project managers and printing and mailing teams bringing insight, support, and problem solving.**
*I am happy to be an oracle of information relating to the status of projects, correct mail codes, technology support, etc.*
