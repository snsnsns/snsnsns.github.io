I'm Sarah Schumacher, a designer and marketer based in Middlebury. I've created this specific page to highlight samples of my work. 

In recent roles, I have worn many hats: art director, marketing designer, photographer, videographer, social media editor, writer, and editor. For the past three years, I've worked on marketing design for [Healthy Living markets](https://healthylivingtogo.com), I have been instrumental in the environmental signage design at HL stores in South Burlington, Williston, and Saratoga Springs, NY. Through my digital marketing efforts, the company has built a robust trade partners program with small, local, food-oriented businesses we collaborate with to create special in-store marketing, as well as targeted Google and Meta ads.

As an editorial designer, I worked for [Voice Media Group](https://www.voicemediagroup.com/), a media company with news sites in Dallas, Phoenix, Miami, and Denver. I collaborated with cross-functional teams and organized complex projects to meet tight deadlines. At the <em>Dallas Observer</em>, I directed the photographers and illustrators to create art for each feature story online and in print, designed a weekly newspaper, created marketing materials, and occasionally wrote stories. For <em>[Dallas Observer](https://www.dallasobserver.com)</em>'s Instagram, I edited photographs, wrote content, and developed the social media community through positive interactions.

Now I manage marketing and social media for the [Middlebury Ski & Snowboard Club](https://www.middleburyskiandsnowboardclub.org) as a volunteer. In my role, I redesigned and now update the website, manage the social media, photograph and create videos of events, create graphics for posters, fliers, design advertisements for print and email newsletters, and design swag and apparel. I love experimenting with META ads, keywords and demographics when creating ads for social media. It can be so rewarding to see a campaign succeed â€” like the recent ad I created for our MSSC movie night, <em>Pressure Drop</em>. The post I've created for the film screening has received thousands of impressions. My plan for the winter season is to expand our social media video coverage into weekly program recaps through first-person GoPro footage of teams on the mountain.

<strong>For Dallas Observer/Voice Media Group</strong>

As an editorial designer at Voice Media Group, I shot photos, hired photographers and curated photos, created graphics, wrote content, and built a fun social media persona and built community through VMG's <em>Dallas Observer</em> Instagram account. I hired photographers to shoot events and then edited and selected photos for use on the various VMG platforms.

### Video Samples

<strong>Instagram Reels for Middlebury Ski & Snowboard Club</strong>
[Fall Family Weekend](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPc2CfVjamS/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=bHEwczAzbHBwZXdn): I was volunteering for a few days at the Middlebury Snowbowl during Middlebury College's fall family weekend. While recruiting college-aged ski coaches and encouraging families to consider the winter program, I filmed a reel to help us achieve the same goals but with broader reach, through social media. I filmed this with my iPhone and edited it in CapCut.

[U14 Racers warming up at Saskadena 6 mountain](https://www.instagram.com/p/DEvNXB1PmEz/?img_index=1): Take a warm-up lap with the U14 racers in this Instagram video (filmed with a GoPro). I filmed (and posted) this as a one-shot first-person POV video prior to a race at Saskadena Six, a small independent mountain near Barnard, VT.

<strong>Fun behind-the-scenes editorial video for Dallas Observer</strong>
 <div style="text-align: center;">
<video width="560" height="315" src="/images/BisouBisou_DO.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></div>
This video looks behind the scenes at the Dallas-based bakery Bisou Bisou of bakers making pistachio croissants. <em>Dallas Observer</em> had sustained website engagement through a short form video section for a few years (2018-2021) and then pivoted those efforts to Instagram Reels. The best performing videos lifted the veil on viewers' favorite restaurants, artists, and local music scene. When I wasn't hiring videographers to produce these stories, I really enjoyed the chances I had to film and edit the shorts.

<strong>Marketing video from Iron Fork</strong>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EcYfEhalVUE?si=zWoE184HsTOIS0n0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Voice Media Group has many marketed events alongside their news sites. Iron Fork is an annual foodie event with local restaurants bringing small plates to serve to guests. The event also has a local chef cook-off presentation. I filmed and edited video of the 2017 Iron Fork (a <em>Dallas Observer</em> food event).

### Marketing design for Healthy Living
Although portfolio images of design work were not requested, I can't help but share the visual, physical, and digital ecosystem I've created at Healthy Living markets since 2022 (photos are my own):

## In-store signage
Here are environmental displays with infographic posters and specific deal and product signage at all three Healthy Living stores.

</div>

## Environmental design
The South Burlington store wanted to refresh exterior vinyl graphics to something more timeless and aligned with the HL brand, so I created these simple green and bright green graphic layouts for window clings.

## Digital menu design
I continually revise and redesign digital menus for the Williston deli counter. Here is a recent iteration.

## Packaging Design for Healthy Living
Healthy Living launched a private label and I've been involved with the packaging design for many products, from vitamins to coffee packaging. This cold brew design is being relaunched this summer along with another canned coffee product.

## Digital web ads
I designed these web ads for Healthy Living for recruiting new employees on the highly trafficked Seven Days site as rotating "site skin" ads for the news site pages. 
<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/blogimages/HealthyLiving/sevendayssiteskin_hl.jpg" width="60%">

## Newsletter graphics
Mobile-first newsletter Figma graphics advertise Best Deals, HL To-Go, and offer a friendly note from the store-founding family.
