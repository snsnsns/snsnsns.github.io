 Since the early aughts, I was interesting in editorial design while also writing for American University's *Eagle*. In 2003, I was lucky to join an amazing team at *Foreign Policy* and produce editorial work worthy of a National Magazine award. After *FP*, I worked in New York at various titles, including *Fortune*, Conde Nast's *Menswear* magazine, *Everyday with Rachel Ray*, *Budget Travel* and Bloomberg News. In 2009, I pursued a masters in typeface design at the University of Reading, England. I joined the marketing team at California State University Channel Islands as a lead graphic designer working on expanding the reach and brand of the university. Since then, I've also expanded my work into social media design, event design, web design, illustration and photography. Most recently, I have been art directing the alternative weekly and news site *The Dallas Observer*.
