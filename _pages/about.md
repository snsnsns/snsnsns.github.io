description: Art Direction & Design
---
I am a multi-disciplinary designer specializing in editorial design and art direction. I have worked as a journalist and graphic designer since the early aughts. I studied in England and received a masters of arts in typeface design from the University of Reading in 2010. It feels at times that I am semi-nomadic, having also lived on both coasts, the South, and now back to the city I was born in — St. Louis, Missouri.
