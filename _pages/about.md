Hi! I'm an art director and graphic designer based in Vermont. I have been working in editorial design since the early aughts, since writing for and designing American University's *Eagle*. In 2003, I was lucky to join an amazing team at *Foreign Policy* and produce editorial work worthy of a National Magazine award. After *FP*, I worked in New York at various titles, including *Fortune*, Conde Nast's *Menswear* magazine, *Everyday with Rachel Ray*, *Budget Travel* and Bloomberg News. In 2009, I pursued a masters in typeface design at the University of Reading, England. Since then, I've expanded my work into event design, marketing, illustration and type design. I am currently also the art director at *Dallas Observer*.
