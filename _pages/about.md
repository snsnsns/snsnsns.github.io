description: Art Direction & Design
---
I am a journalist, graphic designer and art director at *Dallas Observer*. I studied journalism and international relations at American University as my undergrad and earned a masters of arts in typeface design from the University of Reading, England in 2010. Some day I'll finish a typeface. 

I've lived in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, Southern California, Washington, D.C., Reading and Berlin. My work has been heavily design for print and web, but I also create data-driven graphics, do event design, brand design and marketing. I'm available for freelance work.
