I began my career working as an editorial designer in the magazine publishing world. Now, I enjoy working on a variety of projects – from logo and brand design to packaging design, digital marketing to web design and social media. I have a masters degree in typeface design from the University of Reading which has been an invaluable skill for lettering projects and logo design. I have a bachelors in journalism and communications from American University in D.C. I've been lucky to live in many parts of the world, mostly in the United States, but even luckier to now call Vermont home.
