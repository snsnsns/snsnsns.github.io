description: Art Direction & Design
---
I am a graphic designer and the art director at *Dallas Observer*. I have been working in editorial design since the early aughts, when I started as an editor and production manager at American University's Eagle newspaper. Post college, I was working in New York at Condé Nast's men's fashion weekly when the recession hit in the late aughts. So, I decided to follow my interest in typography and studied in England. I received a masters of arts in typeface design from the University of Reading in 2010. In 2012, my partner and I left New York for his career in live-event/theater technology, which brought us to Southern California, followed by Texas. It feels at times that I am semi-nomadic, having also lived on both coasts, the Midwest and the South. But I've loved everywhere I've ended up and feel lucky to be strongly aquainted with America.
