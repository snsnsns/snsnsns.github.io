description: Art Direction & Design
---
I am a graphic designer and the art director at *Dallas Observer*. I have been working in editorial design since the early aughts. I studied in England and received a masters of arts in typeface design from the University of Reading in 2010. It feels at times that I am semi-nomadic, having also lived on both coasts, the Midwest and the South.
