I'm Sarah, a designer and digital marketer. I've created this specific page to highlight some of the work that might appeal to you in your search for the Creative Manager role.

In recent design roles, I have worn many hats: art director, marketing designer, photographer, videographer, social media editor, writer, and editor. For the past three years, as a consultant for [Healthy Living markets](https://healthylivingtogo.com), I have been instrumental in the environmental signage design at HL stores in South Burlington, Williston, and Saratoga Springs, NY. Through my digital marketing efforts, the company has a robust trade partners program with small and local food-oriented businesses who we partner with to create special in-store marketing, targeted Google ads and META ads. I've been dedicated to the branding and member development of the Core Shopper loyalty program that includes weekly deals to target shoppers.

At [Voice Media Group](https://www.voicemediagroup.com/) a media conglomerate with news sites in Dallas, Phoenix, Miami and Denver, I collaborated with cross-functional teams and organized complex projects to meet tight deadlines. Every year, I managed the creative for an omnichannel product (web, social, television, radio and print) called [“Best of Dallas.”](https://www.dallasobserver.com/best-of/2024/intro/best-of-dallas-2024-20596760) This required hiring, directing and managing many vendors (photographers, models, writers, editors, illustrators, videographers, marketers) to design and launch a blockbuster product for all of Dallas.

I'd like to showcase some of the work that I've done that might help you see my capabilities:

### Marketing design for Healthy Living

## In-store signage
Here are environmental displays with infographic posters and specific deal and product signage at all three Healthy Living stores.

## Environmental design
The South Burlington store wanted to refresh exterior vinyl graphics to something more timeless and aligned with the HL brand, so I created these simple green and bright green graphic layouts for window clings.

## Digital menu design
I continually revise and redesign digital menus for the Williston deli counter. Here is a recent iteration.

## Packaging Design for Healthy Living
Healthy Living launched a private label and I've been involved with the packaging design for many products, from vitamins to coffee packaging. This cold brew design is being relaunched this summer along with another canned coffee product.

## Digital ads for Healthy Living recruitment
I designed these web ads for Healthy Living for recruiting new employees on the highly trafficked Seven Days site as rotating "site skin" ads for the news site pages.

## Merch design for Healthy Living
I designed reusable bags with drop-shift citrus patterns for Healthy Living.

Another fun project was creating these cooler bags which are sturdy and attractive.

### Social Media, Video and Photography with Voice Media Group

In the social media space, I have experience planning and designing digital marketing campaigns.

## Dallas Observer Social Media
As art director at Voice Media Group, I shot photos, hired photographers and curated photos, created graphics, wrote content and built a fun social media persona and built community through VMG's Dallas Observer Instagram account. I hired photographers to shoot events and then edited and selected photos for use on the various VMG platforms.

## Marketing video from Iron Fork 
Voice Media Group has many marketed events alongside their news sites. Iron Fork is an annual foodie event with local restaurants bringing small plates to serve to guests. The event also has a local chef cook-off presentation. I filmed and edited video of the 2017 Iron Fork for VMG's site [Dallas Observer] (https://www.dallasobserver.com).

## Event and video design from Dallas Observer Music Awards
Every year, Dallas Observer highlights the best musical acts trending in the city. For VMG's marketing department, I created the event brand which involved designing the logo/graphic for the event, the awards design, display ads, projected videos to introduce speakers and performers and visuals for performances.

And I commissioned this video of 2016 Dallas Observer Music Awards that shows the event design, award design, presentation graphics and cohesive background video design.

### Event & Marketing Design for AIGA Santa Barbara
As a volunteer board member for AIGA in California, I designed and planned a conference for young designers to meet with mentors for career advice, networking, and for a formal portfolio review. For the event, I created a lot of collateral: posters, fake tattoos, t-shirts and buttons.

## Event Poster for AIGA
I designed this poster for AIGA Santa Barbara advertising the portfolio review day.

And here is the fun swag: temporary tattoos, small buttons, and we screen printed t-shirts with the event design too.
