In 2015, journalist Holly Bailey wrote a book about the tornado culture of Oklahoma with detailed interviews from the 2013 tornado (category EF5) in Moore that killed 24 people (some school-aged children) and injured 212. Moore, a suburb of Oklahoma City, was devestated. I created a landing site for her book using Wordpress and also illustrated a few maps for her book. Holly included photos she took of the destruction she witnessed, also visible on the site, [MercyoftheSky.com](http://www.mercyofthesky.com/).
