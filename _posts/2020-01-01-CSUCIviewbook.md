Cal State University Channel Islands is a gem of a small public university in beautiful Camarillo, right on the Pacific coast. I worked there full time in the marketing department as a designer for a few years and still enjoy working with them on design projects. In 2018, I helped alter the design of the 2019 [viewbook](https://issuu.com/csu-channel-islands/docs/19_viewbookfull_issuu) with the enrollment team. In our design of the viewbook, it was important to show a diverse set of students (differing abilities, races, genders, ages) and to highlight the beauty of the campus and the great value of the education. In late summer 2019, we overhauled the design of the 2020 viewbook. Here are the spreads of that design:
