## Young People Get 'Dropped Off at the Doorstep' of This Dallas Youth Center

Homeless youths can often go unnoticed, but not at the Fannie C. Harris Youth Center in Dallas. The homeless center for people between the ages of 14 and 21 that Salathain has come to appreciate is run by an organization called After8toEducate. Dunn first learned about After8toEducate online after looking for homeless programs. Asked what keeps bringing him back, he said, “The joy. The happiness. The love.”
