In December of every year, the Dallas Observer hosts its annual music awards event that involves a showcase of local bands performing in Deep Ellum, followed by an award ceremony a few days later. As art director, I created branding for the event, which included designing event graphics, award graphics and background video to play during musical acts. DOMA (Dallas Observer Music Awards) is an annual [event](https://www.dallasobservermusicawards.com/). Besides the identity for the awards show, I also created the concept for the entire editorial music awards editorial issue and produced print and web ads on [Dallasobserver.com](http://www.dallasobserver.com). <i>Photography by Ed Steele</i>

And for the editorial issue of the Dallas Observer to preview the artists and the event, I worked with photographer Jason Janik and the musicians to create engaging portraits in Deep Ellum, Texas:
