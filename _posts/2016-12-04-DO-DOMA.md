In December of every year, the Dallas Observer hosts its annual music awards event that involves a showcase of local bands performing in Deep Ellum, followed by an award ceremony a few days later. As art director, I created event graphics and background video to play during musical acts. Here is the annual :[event site](https://www.dallasobservermusicawards.com/). Besides event design, I also created the concept for the entire editorial music awards issue, identity and branding for the event theme, and executed production for both print and web ads on [Dallasobserver.com](http://www.dallasobserver.com).

And for the editorial issue of the Dallas Observer to preview the artists and the event, I worked with photographer Jason Janik and the musicians to create engaging portraits in Deep Ellum, Texas:
