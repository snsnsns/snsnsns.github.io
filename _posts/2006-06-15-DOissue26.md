## Description

Editor Beth Rankin and her team scoured Dallas for the best patios, pool decks, cocktails and frozen pi√±a coladas for the summer of 2017. I hired photographer Kathy Tran who scouted some models for a poolside rooftop photoshoot. I had the idea to make the cover image a poppy graphic photo that screamed chic relaxation. The feature had a lot of data points that I used graphics to explain each location's ammenities.
