In December 2020, [STEM STL Ecosystem] (https://www.https://stemstl.org/) reached out to get support creating t-shirts that supported their cause: Improving Access to Quality STEM Learning. The team wanted to create feminist, inclusive apparel that learners of all ages would be proud wearing.STEM STL provided me with their slogans and I focused on a fun design that would work well knocked out on a black t-shirt. The color scheme is a bright primary palette that matches the STEM STL logo. I incorporated a simple monolinear illustration with a script typeface that felt friendly and learning oriented.
