In the spring of 2012, I was working for Budget Travel as an art director and UI designer for the site. The magazine was going through a sale and restructuring at the time and only a couple photo editors and I remained in the art department to create the May issue. The cover was of Ireland, but we went through so many iterations to make it look bright and appealing. The feature better portrays the photographic allure of Ireland.

During the couple of years that I worked at Budget Travel, we had a lot of fun with gear shoots and destination explainers. I love this spread we did comparing and contrasting Santa Fe with Sedona. And for the Tuscany issue in July 2012, I even tried my hand at watercolor map illustration.
