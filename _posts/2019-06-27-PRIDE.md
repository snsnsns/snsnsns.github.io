The Riverfront Times has partnered with Pride St. Louis for a few years in producing a printed guide for Pridefest that takes place in St. Louis in late June. RFT also publishes OUT in STL, a quarterly magazine for the LBGTQ community of St. Louis. This special guide included a small version of OUT in STL within its pages. I designed the guide in 2018 and 2019. Here are some choice spreads from the guide and the sections of OUT in STL.
