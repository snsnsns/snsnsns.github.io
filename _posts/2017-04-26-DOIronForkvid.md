On April 26, 2017, I followed social media editor Paige Skinner as she sampled the offerings at Iron Fork, a Dallas Observer food-centric marketing event at Fair Park in Dallas. More than 2,500 guests attended and dozens of DFW restaurants were represented. Paige is a bit of a comedian, hence the occassional gags and smiles. It was a fun video to plan and edit, although an obvious first for me with sound and shooting.
