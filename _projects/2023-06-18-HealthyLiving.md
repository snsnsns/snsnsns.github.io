## Description

I've been working with the locally-owned and operated grocery chain, Healthy Living, since the Fall of 2022. In partnership with the management and their consultants, we are evolving the Healthy Living brand and marketing new incentives to a loyal customer base with a robust rewards program (Core Shoppers). Besides customers, I've also served the brand and design needs of partnering local businesses selling their products within the stores. 

## Branding and packaging for Healthy Living
I designed the a new suite of private label products for Healthy Living including this cold-brew coffee label.

I created this custom logo for eco-friendly reusable salad bar containers at Healthy Living.

## Digital ads for Healthy Living recruitment
I designed these web ads for Healthy Living using the newest brand standards in Fall 2023 for recruiting new employees on the highly trafficked [Seven Days site](https://www.sevendaysvt.com) as rotating "site skin" ads for the news site pages.

## Reusable bags design
I designed reusable bags with drop-shift citrus patterns for Healthy Living in spring 2023.

Another fun project was creating these cooler bags which are sturdy and attractive. It is my favorite cooler bag to shop with.

## Product signage at Healthy Living South Burlington and Saratoga Springs stores
I've designed many types of signage for Healthy Living. Here are a few signs with special purchase deals and one infographic poster about avocado sourcing.

## Flyers and print display advertising
I created include an hiring ad and a Thanksgiving pre-order sides and turkeys ad in the weekly Vermont newspaper, <em>Seven Days</em>. Other print products I designed for Healthy Living include recruitment flyers showing off hiring benefits.

Healthy Living has a customer rewards program called Core Shopper. We wanted to bring awareness to the program in a fun, educational way with icons and short explainers. These flyers are handed out to customers at the registers.
