For the past three years, as a consultant for Healthy Living markets  , I have been instrumental in the environmental signage design at HL stores in South Burlington, Williston, and Saratoga Springs, NY. Through my digital marketing efforts, the company has a robust trade partners program with small and local food-oriented businesses who we partner with to create special in-store marketing, targeted Google ads and META ads. Iâ€™ve been dedicated to the branding and member development of the Core Shopper loyalty program that includes weekly deals to target shoppers.

## In-store signage
Here are environmental displays with infographic posters and specific deal and product signage at all three Healthy Living stores.

## Environmental design
The South Burlington store wanted to refresh exterior vinyl graphics to something more timeless and aligned with the HL brand, so I created these simple green and bright green graphic layouts for window clings.

## Digital menu design
I continually revise and redesign digital menus for the Williston deli counter. Here is a recent iteration.

## Loyalty rewards program
I've been working with the locally-owned and operated grocery chain, Healthy Living, since the Fall of 2022. The Healthy Living brand is evolving and we are marketing new incentives to a loyal customer base with a robust rewards program (Core Shoppers). Besides customers, I've also served the brand and design needs of local businesses partners selling their products within the stores.

## Packaging Design for Healthy Living
Healthy Living launched a private label and I've been involved with the packaging design for many products, from vitamins to coffee packaging. This cold brew design is being relaunched this summer along with another canned coffee product.

Healthy Living has a customer rewards program called Core Shopper. We wanted to bring awareness to the program in a fun, educational way with icons and short explainers. These flyers are handed out to customers at the registers.
