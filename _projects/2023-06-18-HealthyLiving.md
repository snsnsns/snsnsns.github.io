## Description

I've been working with the locally-owned and operated grocery chain, Healthy Living, since the Fall of 2022. In partnership with the management and their consultants, we are evolving the Healthy Living brand and marketing new incentives to a loyal customer base with a robust rewards program (Core Shoppers). Besides customers, I've also served the brand and design needs of partnering local businesses selling their products within the stores.

The design work has spanned from digital ads, email blasts, and social media posts to in-store signage, branded packaging, and print ads.

Beyond marketing materials, I've also designed Healthy Living merchandise such as reusable shopping bags, reusable freezer bags, stickers, eco-friendly utensil sets, hats and apparel.

Hiring has been really difficult since COVID in Vermont and upstate New York. I also have been working with human resources to bring awareness to the benefits of working at Healthy Living through colorful flyers and print advertisements in *Seven Days* weekly paper.
