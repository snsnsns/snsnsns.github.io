description: A look at Sarah Schumacher's work in marketing, event, social media and packaging design
---

I'm Sarah, a graphic designer based in Middlebury. I've created this specific page to highlight some of the work that might appeal to you in your search for a designer at Tenth Crow Creative. I'd love to work with a studio that offers opportunities to work on a variety of projects in different industries.

Most recently, I've been working on a contract basis with the team at [Healthy Living Market](https://www.healthylivingmarket.com) creating digital assets for email marketing, web display ads for sites such as Seven Days, designing display ads for marketing at UVM sporting events creating in-store signage, and designing brand packaging and customer-targeted products (shopping bags, reusable utensils, stickers, apparel and accessories).

In my prior design role, I wore many hats: art director, marketing designer, news designer, photographer, writer, editor, videographer, social  media editor. At [Voice Media Group](https://www.voicemediagroup.com/_) a media conglomerate with news sites in Dallas, Phoenix, Miami and Denver, I collaborated with cross-functional teams and organized complex projects to meet tight deadlines. Every year, I managed the creative for an omnichannel product (web, social, television and print) called “Best of Dallas.” This required hiring, directing and managing many vendors (photographers, models, writers, editors, illustrators, videographers, marketers) to design and launch a blockbuster product for all of Dallas.

I'd like to showcase some of the work that I've done that might help you see my capabilities:

### Work Examples

I've been working with the locally-owned and operated grocery chain, Healthy Living, since the Fall of 2022. In partnership with the management and their consultants, we are evolving the Healthy Living brand and marketing new incentives to a loyal customer base with a robust rewards program (Core Shoppers). Besides customers, I've also served the brand and design needs of partnering local businesses selling their products within the stores. 

## Branding and packaging for Healthy Living
I designed the a new suite of private label products for Healthy Living including this cold-brew coffee label.

## Digital ads for Healthy Living recruitment
I designed these web ads for Healthy Living using the newest brand standards in Fall 2023 for recruiting new employees on the highly trafficked [Seven Days site](https://www.sevendaysvt.com) as rotating "site skin" ads for the news site pages.

Another fun project was creating these cooler bags which are sturdy and attractive. It is my favorite cooler bag to shop with.

## Product signage at Healthy Living South Burlington and Saratoga Springs stores
I've designed many types of signage for Healthy Living. Here are a few signs with special purchase deals and one infographic poster about avocado sourcing.

## Flyers and print display advertising
I created include an hiring ad and a Thanksgiving pre-order sides and turkeys ad in the weekly Vermont newspaper, <em>Seven Days</em>. Other print products I designed for Healthy Living include recruitment flyers showing off hiring benefits.

Healthy Living has a customer rewards program called Core Shopper. We wanted to bring awareness to the program in a fun, educational way with icons and short explainers. These flyers are handed out to customers at the registers.

### Dallas Observer Social Media
In the social media space, I have experience planning and designing digital marketing campaigns. As a marketing designer at Voice Media Group, I shot photos, hired photographers and curated photos, created graphics, wrote content and built a fun social media persona and built community through VMG's Dallas Observer Instagram account. I hired photographers to shoot events and then edited and selected photos for use on the various VMG platforms.

## Marketing video from Iron Fork 
Voice Media Group has many marketed events alongside their news sites. Iron Fork is an annual foodie event with local restaurants bringing small plates to serve to guests. The event also has a local chef cook-off presentation. I filmed and edited video of the 2017 Iron Fork for VMG's site Dallas Observer.

## Event and video design from Dallas Observer Music Awards
 Every year, Dallas Observer highlights the best musical acts trending in the city. For VMG's marketing department, I created the event brand which involved designing the logo/graphic for the event, the awards design, display ads, projected videos to introduce speakers and performers and visuals for performances.
