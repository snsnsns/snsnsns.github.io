## Description

A $100 hamburger is a generic term used by pilots who fly for an hour or so, grab a bite to eat — not necessarily a hamburger — then fly back home. There was a time when such an endeavor, with gas and food, cost about $100. Thus, a “$100 hamburger.” Now it costs a bit more, depending on the distance, but the original phrase has stuck.

These are mostly general aviation pilots flying to smaller regional airports for hobby or students accumulating flight hours. Photographer Kathy Tran was able to do a cool ride along with the pilots in shooting this feature.
