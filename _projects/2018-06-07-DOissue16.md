## Description

Landlord or slumlord? Is Khraish Khraish here to help Dallas' poor or as the city frames it, is he taking advantage of them by offering them sub-par housing options. Columnist Jim Schutze explores this question in depth. For this cover, I wanted to show the humanity of Khraish Khraish, which rarely comes across in the gentrification fights that landlords and the city get into over viable land for condo-fication. So I took a nice serious portrait Mark Graham had shot of him and added a provocative small question: Is this the most controversial man in Dallas?
