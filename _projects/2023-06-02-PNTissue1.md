## Description

I filled in as art director at Phoenix New Times from March until mid-June 2023. This cover was so much fun to work on. PNT was creating a guide for Fan Fusion, a con that takes place in Phoenix. The editors were looking for an eye-catching cover that referenced the comic world, so I reached out to Bryan Kelly, who I had illustrate a cover for Dallas Observer earlier in 2022. He did a fantastic job creating an interesting would-be scene from Fan Fusion's main hall.
