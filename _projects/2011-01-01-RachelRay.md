__Every Day with Rachel Ray__
In fall 2010, I worked with the editorial team at Every Day with Rachel Ray on redesigning the magazine. We created many prototypes for new sections, played with creative typography options, and added many realistic layers of texture to the pages to make a fun, engaging magazine for readers.
