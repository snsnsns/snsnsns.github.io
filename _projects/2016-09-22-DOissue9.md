## Description

When I started my position at DO, I was told the theme for the "Best of Dallas" issue was "Make Dallas Great Again." At this point in the election cycle, most people were sick of the mudslinging in the lead-up to the 2016 election. The last thing I wanted to do was make the special issue of the year a bunch of illustrations of Trump and Clinton sparring it out. So we flipped the concept and made the issue about the greatest things in the greatest times in Dallas history. We highlighted the Cowboys in the 1960s, the '80s punk scene in Deep Ellum,the 1920s performances at the Adolphus hotel, the Neiman Marcus ladies of the 1950s, and the state fair today in whimsical illustrations by Chris Danger. Because in the eyes of the <em>Dallas Observer</em>, Dallas was and is already great.
