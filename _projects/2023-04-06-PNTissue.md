### 100 Days of Katie Hobbs

The Phoenix New Times looks back at the struggles and strife Governor Katie Hobbs has faced as the first Democrat in office since Janet Napolitano who left office in 2009.

For this story, I hired illustrator Charlie Powell to do a fun political caricature of Hobbs and her harrassing colleagues. Powell did a great job of striking a balance in accurately representing all the players, while keeping it interesting and amusing.
