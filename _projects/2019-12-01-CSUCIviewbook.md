Cal State University Channel Islands is a gem of a small public university in beautiful Camarillo, right on the Pacific coast. I worked there full time in the marketing department as a designer for a few years and still enjoy working with them on design projects. 

In 2018, I helped alter the design of the 2019 [viewbook](https://issuu.com/csu-channel-islands/docs/19_viewbookfull_issuu) with the recruitment team. In our design of the viewbook, it was important to show a diverse set of students (differing abilities, races, genders, ages) and to highlight the beauty of the campus and the great value of the education. In late summer 2019, we overhauled the design of the 2020 viewbook. Here are the spreads of that design:

Here is some other current work from California State University that speaks to the variety of projects that I have taken on there:

### Recruitment
This is a two-sided brochure with the top ten reasons to attend CSUCI. The reverse side is a campus photo and hashtag phrase that recruitment uses for social media engagement.

This is a postcard invitation to incoming freshman to visit campus for an early orientation and community building event in which the university is able to compile data as to which students they are targeting are following through with enrollment.

### Branding
**Project AYUDAS** is a grant-based project to support first-generation college students to find academic success in science, technology, engineering and math. This is the full-color logo I created for their project.

In another branding project of CSUCI, called **Channel Your Success**, I designed banners for campus. The image to the left is a mockup of the banner. The image on the right is a mock up of the logo on a banner on campus.

### Publications

Recruitment and Enrollment department needed internship hiring guides for both students ([Internship Guide for Students, Faculty and Staff](https://issuu.com/csu-channel-islands/docs/2021_internshipguidestudentfaculty_issuu)) and potential employers ([Internship Toolkit for Employers and Community Partners](https://issuu.com/csu-channel-islands/docs/2021_employerinternshiptoolkit_issuu)). These toolkits work as an internship guides for both parties.

**Channel magazine** includes alumni features, profiles on major donors, campus news in the community, and a Spring listing of donors and fundraising data.
