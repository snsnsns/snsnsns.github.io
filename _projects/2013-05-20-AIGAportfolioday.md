I served as the vice president of AIGA Santa Barbara in 2013 and had the responsibility of planning, designing, and running a student portfolio review day at Lynda.com (now LinkedIn Learning) in Carpenteria, California. I tapped designer Aoife Mooney to help create a logo to go with the theme the AIGA board had thought up: "Vizualize and Realize Your Creative Career". We kept the design bright and friendly and accessible.

For branding the event, we had matching table placards and signage. I designed a postcard, a poster, and web assets.

I also designed swag for goodie bags: temporary tattoos and pink buttons. After the event, our AIGA board worked with a local screenprinter to print our own t-shirts using the event logo.
