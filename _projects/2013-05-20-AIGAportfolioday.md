I served as the vice president of AIGA Santa Barbara in 2013 and had the responsibility of branding, designing, planning, organizing and running a student portfolio review day at Lynda.com (now LinkedIn Learning) in Carpenteria, California. I hired type designer Aoife Mooney to draw the lettering for "Visualize and Realize Your Creative Career". The visual identity for the event is bright, upbeat and friendly to reflect AIGA's hopes for students' futures: a bright horizon ahead.

Within the event identity, I designed matching table placards and signage, as well as a postcard, a poster, and digital assets for social media, web advertising, email banners, etc.

I also designed swag for goodie bags: temporary tattoos and pink buttons. After the event, our AIGA board worked with a local screenprinter to print our own t-shirts using the event logo.
