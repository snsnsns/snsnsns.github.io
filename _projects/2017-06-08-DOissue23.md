## Description

This feature is a personal pride piece because I wrote the story as well as hiring duo Sarah Reyes and Daniel Driensky to photograph and  produce [a video of signpainter Sean Starr](https://www.dallasobserver.com/video/on-the-job-with-sign-painters-starr-studios-2mcUj3Ho) at work. I first learned about Starr through the documentary, [Sign Painters](http://www.signpaintersfilm.com/), which I was very interested in as a graphic designer and typophile. I even hosted a viewing of the film in Santa Barbara at an AIGA event that concluded with a Q&A with a few local sign painters featured in the documentary.
