## Description

Kim Gatlin wrote the book, Good Christian Bitches in 2008. After a failed run of ten episodes of the ABC show, GCB, based on the book, CW is planning to return the series to TV. 

> “I mean it's like, with the show coming back it's like I've hit the lottery twice,” Gatlin says. “This shit doesn't happen. You don't write a book for the first time in your mid-40s and have Darren Star make it into a TV show. That just doesn't happen.”
