## Description

For a retrospective of Mayor Mike Rawlings long and storied tenure in Dallas, we wanted to give him a good tribute. Illustrator John Jay Cabuay seemed to fit the bill as a great portrait illustrator with vibrancy and motion to his work. He created a fitting illustration for the cover.
