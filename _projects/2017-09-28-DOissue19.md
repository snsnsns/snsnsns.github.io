## Description

For the Best of Dallas 2017, we wanted to celebrate the economic engine that was North Texas at the time. Uber was talking about testing flying cars in Dallas. Space X and and tech companies were booming. Looking toward an innovative future seemed to strike the right tone. I hired illustrator Same Chivers to envision this bold new world. His execution did not disappoint.
