## Description

The restaurant industry is suffering with a lack of filled positions. Writer Kristina Rowe interviews a former chef to find out why he left the industry. 

For this story, I hired Kelsey Dake to take on some edgy lettering for the cover. I love her ability to convey liquid in type and the bold color choices she makes in her illustration. With this cover illustration, we wanted to evoke a messy diner table after a meal if no workers were there to clean up.
