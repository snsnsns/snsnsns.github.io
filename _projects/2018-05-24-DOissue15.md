## Description

DO food critic Brian Reinhart highlights "Dallasâ€™ next culinary revolution" in his story about the young generation of Laotian-American restauranteurs. For the cover, I worked with photographer Kathy Tran to evoke an image that hinted at the motherland of these chefs and colorful flavor of the food. She photographed owner and chef Anita Dangerfield of Mai Eats with some fitting palm leaves and bright makeup for a evocative cover image.
