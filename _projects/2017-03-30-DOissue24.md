## Description

The Dallas International Film Festival is a stellar event and this feature unpacks a few of the 170 film offers available at the event. To illustrate this, I thought it would be fun to have film-related objects popping out of a cowboy hat to get at the Texas element in the institution. I hired Katrin Rodegast to produce paper cut illustration so detailed that some readers might confuse the objects as real.
