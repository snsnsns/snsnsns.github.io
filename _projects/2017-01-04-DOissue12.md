## Description

I love illustrator Mario Wagner's illustration style. He can make even the most mundane stories about gentrification exciting as an '80s action film with his elegant collage style. Here we see the main players of both sides of the West Dallas gentrification fight, with former-mayor Mike Rawlings crowning the pack and smaller players former representative Eric Johnson, landowners Khraish Khraish and Dennis Topletz rounding out the bottom tier. Photographer Mark Graham shot the portraits.
