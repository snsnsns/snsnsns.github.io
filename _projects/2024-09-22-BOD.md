### Best of Dallas 2024

For the Best of Dallas 2024, the theme was The Lone Star Metropolis, framing Dallas as an international city on the make rather than a dusty forgotten cowtown. DFW is on fire and there is no doubting the economic and cultural powerhouse that the metropolitan area has become. For this special issue, I reached out to Japanese illustrator Yuki Uebo, who had crafted beautiful busy street scenes of cities like Tokyo. I wanted to bring this busy electric aesthetic to The Lone Star Metropolis issue. Each opening image Uebo illustrated is a joy to unpack visually:
