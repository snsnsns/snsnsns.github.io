As an art director at Budget Travel, I worked on many global travel features. I designed the cover, "Timeless Ireland." Another fun feature to design with amazing photography â€” "Best Places You've Never Heard Of."

Here is another feature design about boutique hotels with fun icons to show amenities.

### Photo Direction for Gear Shoot 

At Budget Travel, we had a lot of fun with gear shoots. For this design, we shot the gear, designed the page, printed it, crumpled it and reshot the somewhat crumpled page as the image for the layout. We had to make sure all the copy was edited before going through those steps so we wouldn't have to redo all the work.

### Destination Comparison

Another fun featurette the editorial team created was a comparison tool between two similar destinations. I loved creating this spread comparing and contrasting Santa Fe with Sedona. The little photos in the text draw the eye into the story.

### Map Illustration

For this Essentials guide to Wales, I hand painted the map and designed the page.

For the Tuscany issue in July 2012, I painted the main Tuscany map as well as the inset map of Italy in watercolor.
