As an art director at Budget Travel, I worked on many global travel features.

 We had a lot of fun with gear shoots and destination explainers. For this design, we shot the gear, designed the page, printed it, crumpled it and reshot the somewhat crumpled page as the image for the layout. We had to make sure all the copy was edited before going through those steps so we wouldn't have to redo all the work.

I loved creating this spread comparing and contrasting Santa Fe with Sedona. The little photos in the text draw the eye into the story.

And for the Tuscany issue in July 2012, I painted this watercolor map illustration.
