## Description

Writer Jeff Gage dives into who's who in venue ownership in Dallas' gritty entertainment district, Deep Ellum. To illustrate this, I wanted to do something clever and fun, so I turned to Justin Metz to make my alternative reality for the [classic arrow to Deep Ellum sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Ellum,_Dallas#/media/File:Deep_Ellum_November_2017_04_(Deep_Ellum_Neon_Sign).jpg) into a dollar sign. I asked local photographer Brian Maschino to snap a few good shots of the original signage so that Justin could use his photoshop and 3D rendering tools to create the new signage.
