I started my editorial design career at *Foreign Policy* in 2003. In the five years that I was there, our close-knit team won two National Magazine Awards for Excellence. We were nominated four times within that time frame. Here are a few of my favorite features which I designed and art directed.

__The Failed States Index__
In the third annual Failed States Index, *Foreign Policy* and The Fund for Peace rank the countries where the risk of failure is running high. I created vector overlays showing the level of failure risk for each country. I also worked with the Fund for Peace data to create the charts and infographics.

__Pain at the Pump__
This fun infographic dissects the hidden costs that go into petrol pricing. I helped art direct this beautiful graphic which was created by Linda Eckstein.

__The Debt Frenzy__
I commissioned illustrator Alex Nabaum to create these inventive illustrators that nail the topic in a sophisticated execution. The story is about how investment firms can become aggressive when foreign debt is available for grabbing up.
